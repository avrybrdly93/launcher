# Changelog

Dated, newest-first log of automated session runs against this repo.

**This file is a session log, not the task record.** `ROADMAP.json` remains the
authoritative per-task state: every task's `status`, `validation` criterion, and
its full implementation/verification notes live there, in the same commit as the
code change (see `policy.commitRules`). Entries here say what a _run_ did and
what the next one should pick up, and never restate what `ROADMAP.json` already
records in more detail.

Created 2026-08-05 because the scheduled routine that drives this repo orders its
work by each repo's most-recent changelog entry and this repo had no such file,
forcing a fallback to commit timestamps.

## 2026-08-05 — P4.34 (C⁰-vs-C¹ Cd(Re) convergence degradation exhibit)

- **Done: P4.34** — `packages/solverkit/src/cd-table-smoothness-convergence.test.ts`
  (8 tests). Exhibit as a documented solverkit test module, the P4.09/P4.22 pattern; no new
  UI route was needed. One scenario run twice with **only the `C_d` interpolant differing** —
  the shipped C¹ PCHIP `TabulatedReynoldsCd` against a test-local piecewise-linear interpolant
  over the same `SMOOTH_SPHERE_CD_TABLE` data — same launch state, same `ClassicalRK4Stepper`,
  same step sizes, each measured against its own 2^20-step reference. Full notes in
  `ROADMAP.json` under P4.34.
- **Validation criterion met** ("measured order drop with non-smooth table documented"), on a
  size-5 football (0.43 kg, 0.11 m) launched at 90 m/s / 0.35 rad over 2 s, its Reynolds number
  sweeping **1.356e6 → 4.533e5** and crossing the table's `Re = 1e6` node (asserted, so the
  comparison cannot quietly go vacuous). Fitted log-log order over h ∈ [0.0025, 0.02]:
  **3.68 (C¹) vs 2.15 (C⁰), a drop of 1.53** — RK4 reduced to roughly second-order behaviour
  while still paying four stages per step. Per-h error ratios C⁰/C¹: 47, 958, 683, 537, 12075,
  1182, 2215.
- **Refinement stops being reliable under the C⁰ table**: 2 of the 6 refinements make the error
  _worse_ (1.59e-5 → 1.73e-5, 3.29e-6 → 4.41e-6), and the fit's R² falls 0.92 → 0.85. Where a
  node crossing lands relative to the step grid matters as much as h does, so the error curve is
  no longer a clean power law.
- **Two things are stated rather than rounded off.** The C¹ order is 3.68, _not_ 4: PCHIP is C¹
  but not C², so the fourth-order Taylor argument is not fully available even on the shipped
  path. And the C¹ error curve is not perfectly monotone either (1 non-monotone refinement
  against the C⁰ table's 2), which makes that particular test descriptive rather than
  discriminating — the asserted claim is comparative.
- **A configuration was measured and rejected**: aiming the trajectory through the drag-crisis
  node cluster (40 m/s, 4 s, crossing `Re = 4e5`) also shows the drop (3.06 vs 1.69) but degrades
  the C¹ baseline too, muddying the headline comparison. The single mild `Re = 1e6` crossing is
  the cleaner exhibit.
- **The C⁰ interpolant is deliberately test-local.** §3.3 prescribes PCHIP for the production
  path; exporting a knowingly-inferior interpolant from `@ballista/engine` would invite exactly
  the mistake this exhibit exists to warn about.
- **Verified non-vacuous by mutation**: substituting `TabulatedReynoldsCd` for the piecewise-linear
  model fails exactly the three discriminating tests (order drop, per-h error ratio, work
  comparison) and leaves the five describing interpolant properties or the C¹ path alone passing.
- **Integrator discipline**: dissipative scenario (quadratic drag is the point of it), so classical
  RK4 throughout — no symplectic method appears in the diff, and no stepper, force, or
  golden-trajectory code was touched. The diff is one new test file.
- **Tests**: `pnpm test` **200 files / 1336 tests, all passing** (up from P4.33's 199/1328: +1 file,
  +8 tests). `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:deps` (1170 modules, 3154 dependencies, no
  violations) all clean. Engine and solverkit `docs` clean. `pnpm --filter @ballista/app build`
  succeeds; `check-bundle-size` 60.1 kB gzipped against the 300 kB budget, unchanged — a test-only
  diff cannot move it.
- **Not re-run** (cannot be affected by a test-only diff that touches no stepper, force, or
  cross-engine path; same reasoning P4.28/P4.30/P4.32/P4.33 recorded): `pnpm bench:solverkit`,
  `pnpm check:cross-engine-drift`.
- **Known pre-existing, not introduced here**: `pnpm format:check` flags `CLAUDE.md` (it is not a
  CI step; CI runs typecheck/lint/lint:deps/test/docs/build/bundle-size). The per-package
  `--filter @ballista/viz test` "No test files found" failure documented in P4.30 is also still
  present; root `pnpm test` — CI's own Test step — was used throughout.
- **Next session**: take **P4.35** (force-magnitude stacked-area plot over flight: F_g, F_d, F_M
  shares) — it is the next `todo` in `seq` order and nothing in Phase 4 is `in-progress` or
  `review`. It is self-contained viz work. P4.36 (scenario library v2 curation) and P4.37 (golden
  store v2 + tolerance review) follow; P4.37 touches goldens, so it needs the explanatory
  commit-message note the blueprint's §8.4 requires. Do not reorder phases or skip ahead to the
  P4.38 stretch item.

## 2026-08-05 — P4.33 (two-body/Kepler model registration)

- **Done: P4.33** — `createKeplerModel(mu)` in `packages/engine/src/kepler-model.ts`
  (+ `kepler-model.test.ts`, 13 tests), exported from `packages/engine/src/index.ts`, plus
  `packages/solverkit/src/kepler-invariant-drift.test.ts` (5 tests) carrying the validation
  criterion. Planar two-body problem in fixed-primary form, `r'' = -mu*r/|r|^3`, dim 4
  (`rx, ry, vx, vy`), `partitions {q:[rx,ry], p:[vx,vy]}`. The second non-projectile `Model`
  after P4.31's pendulum and the first with **two** invariants — specific orbital energy and
  specific angular momentum — which is the substance of the task rather than a detail: they
  fail differently under a given integrator, so the pair discriminates where either alone
  would not. Full design/verification notes in `ROADMAP.json` under P4.33.
- **Validation criterion met** ("eccentric orbit: RK4 drifts, Verlet bounded (invariant
  asserts)"), measured on an `a = 1e7 m`, `e = 0.6`, `mu = 3.986e14 m^3/s^2` ellipse released
  at periapsis, 60 orbits at 2000 steps/orbit, identical setup for both runs with only the
  stepper differing. Relative energy error: classical RK4's six block means march
  **-9.30e-10 → -4.26e-9**, monotone, one-signed, with a near-constant per-block increment
  (~6.66e-10, equal to within 5%) — linear in time, the defining shape of a secular term.
  The entire last orbit's band lies strictly outside the entire first orbit's with **no
  overlap** ([-4.59e-9, -3.93e-9] vs [-6.59e-10, -1.0e-12]). Velocity Verlet is **bounded**:
  first- and last-orbit bands agree to 5 significant figures (**7.3134e-5** both) and all six
  block means agree to within 1%, while still oscillating across essentially the full band
  within each orbit. Angular momentum is the control and both steppers hold it (RK4 4.4e-10,
  Verlet 1.6e-14) — it follows from the force being _central_, not from Hamiltonian structure.
- **The comparison is stated honestly**: a dedicated test asserts RK4's error magnitude is
  ~4 orders _smaller_ than Verlet's throughout (order 4 vs order 2). The claim is about the
  **shape** of the error over time, not about Verlet being the more accurate method, and the
  test pins that ordering so a later reader cannot mistake the story.
- **Assertions were measured, not guessed.** Two first-draft thresholds failed against the
  real integrators and were replaced by what the runs actually show: a block-mean ratio guess
  (>5, actual 4.58) became the much stronger constant-increment + band-separation pair, and an
  "error takes both signs" assumption was simply wrong — Verlet's band here is one-signed and
  offset from zero, which is still bounded, which is all the property claims. An argmax-location
  assertion was also tried and discarded: Verlet's band is flat to ~5 significant figures across
  all 60 orbits, so the argmax is decided by last-bit noise (it landed in orbit 44).
- **Verified non-vacuous by mutation**: substituting `ClassicalRK4Stepper` for `VerletStepper`
  throughout the validation file fails exactly the two bounded-error tests and leaves the two
  integrator-agnostic ones (eccentricity fixture, angular momentum) passing — the expected
  pattern, since only those two discriminate integrators.
- **Integrator discipline**: the two-body problem is conservative (no drag, no damping, no
  dissipative path), which is the precondition for the symplectic Verlet stepper used in the
  comparison. No dissipative system is integrated symplectically in this diff; no stepper,
  force, or golden-trajectory code was touched — the diff is two new files plus one export line.
- **Tests**: `pnpm test` **199 files / 1328 tests, all passing** (up from P4.32's 197/1310:
  +2 files, +18 tests). `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:deps` (1167 modules, 3143
  dependencies, no violations) all clean. Engine and solverkit `docs` clean.
  `pnpm --filter @ballista/app build` succeeds; `check-bundle-size` 60.1 kB gzipped against the
  300 kB budget, unchanged — the new model is not imported by the app yet, the same status
  `pendulum-model.ts` has had since P4.31.
- **Not re-run** (cannot be affected by this diff — no stepper touched, no cross-engine physics
  path; same reasoning P4.28/P4.30/P4.32 recorded): `pnpm bench:solverkit`,
  `pnpm check:cross-engine-drift`.
- **Known pre-existing, not introduced here**: `pnpm --filter @ballista/viz test` fails with
  "No test files found" (vitest's root include glob does not resolve under a per-package cwd,
  documented in P4.30's notes); the same affects `--filter @ballista/engine`. Root `pnpm test` —
  CI's own Test step — was used throughout.
- **Next session**: take **P4.34** (Solver Lab exhibit: C⁰-vs-C¹ `C_d(Re)` convergence
  degradation demo, §3.3) — it is the next `todo` in `seq` order and nothing in Phase 4 is
  `in-progress` or `review`. Note it is a _dissipative_ (drag) exhibit, so the standing
  constraint applies directly: use standard RK schemes there, not the symplectic path this
  session exercised. Two ready follow-ons if it proves too large for one session: P4.35
  (force-magnitude stacked-area plot) is self-contained viz work, and the Kepler model landed
  here is now available to `phasePortraitSeries` (P4.32) with no new plumbing — its `partitions`
  give pair 0 = (rx, vx) and pair 1 = (ry, vy). Do not reorder phases or skip ahead to the
  P4.38 stretch item.

## 2026-08-05 — P4.32 (phase-portrait plot pane)

- **Done: P4.32** — phase-portrait pane, `packages/viz/src/phase-portrait.ts`
  (+ `phase-portrait.test.ts`, 17 tests), exported from `packages/viz/src/index.ts`.
  A solve drawn as a (q, p) curve instead of a value-vs-time trace, plus
  `cycleAreas`/`areaGrowthRatio`, which turn the orbit into a number so the
  integrator contrast can be asserted rather than eyeballed. Reuses `plot-pane.ts`'s
  screen mapping and `axes-layer.ts`'s ticks rather than duplicating them. Full
  design/verification notes in `ROADMAP.json` under P4.32.
- **Validation criterion met** ("Euler spiral vs Verlet closed orbit visible
  (automated area-growth assert)"), measured on the P4.31 pendulum — L=1, g=9.81,
  theta0=0.5 rad, h=0.01, t in [0,16], 7 laps, identical setup for both runs with
  only the integrator differing: explicit Euler's per-lap enclosed phase-space area
  grows monotonically **2.679524 → 8.420249** (ratio 3.142442); velocity Verlet holds
  **2.427316 → 2.427316** (ratio 1.000000 to 6 dp).
- **Integrator discipline**: the pendulum is conservative (no drag, no damping, no
  dissipative path), which is the precondition for the symplectic Verlet stepper used
  in the comparison. No dissipative system is integrated symplectically in this diff;
  no stepper or golden-trajectory code was touched.
- **Tests**: `pnpm test` **197 files / 1310 tests, all passing** (up from P4.31's
  196/1293: +1 file, +17 tests). `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:deps`
  (1158 modules, 3119 dependencies, no violations) all clean. Engine and solverkit
  `docs` clean. `pnpm --filter @ballista/app build` succeeds; `check-bundle-size`
  60.1 kB gzipped against the 300 kB budget, unchanged — the new module is not
  imported by the app yet, the same status `plot-pane.ts` has had since P3.29.
- **Not re-run** (cannot be affected by this diff — no stepper, no cross-engine
  physics path; same reasoning P4.28/P4.30 recorded): `pnpm bench:solverkit`,
  `pnpm check:cross-engine-drift`.
- **Known pre-existing, not introduced here**: `pnpm --filter @ballista/viz test`
  fails with "No test files found" (vitest's root include glob does not resolve under
  a per-package cwd, documented in P4.30's notes). Root `pnpm test` — CI's own Test
  step — was used throughout.
- **Next session**: take **P4.33** (two-body/Kepler model registration, Stage-B seed,
  with energy + angular-momentum invariants) — it is the next `todo` in `seq` order and
  nothing in Phase 4 is `in-progress` or `review`. It is also the natural next consumer
  of this session's work: a Kepler orbit is the other classic closed-orbit phase
  portrait, and `phasePortraitSeries` will pick its pair straight off `partitions` with
  no new plumbing. Do not reorder phases or skip ahead to the P4.38 stretch item.

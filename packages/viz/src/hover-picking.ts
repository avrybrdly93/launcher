/**
 * Hover picking (§6.1: "World↔screen transforms are pure functions used by
 * both rendering and picking ... hover-to-inspect a trajectory point shows
 * full state tooltip"; P3.17).
 *
 * `pickNearestTrajectoryPoint` measures distance in *screen* space (via the
 * same `worldToScreen` rendering itself uses, `camera2d.ts`), not world
 * space -- essential under `Camera2D`'s anisotropic scaling (§6.1), where a
 * point a hundred world-units away horizontally can sit only a few pixels
 * from the cursor while one a tenth of a world-unit away vertically sits
 * far off screen. This is also this task's own validation criterion
 * ("picked index correct under zoom"): re-picking after a `zoomAtScreenPoint`
 * call must still resolve to the same trajectory row the cursor is
 * visually nearest to, which only holds if picking transforms every
 * candidate through the *current* camera rather than comparing raw world
 * coordinates.
 *
 * `trajectoryPointTooltip` builds the "full state tooltip" from nothing but
 * the recorded columnar `Trajectory` plus the model's declared
 * `ChannelMeta` (name/unit) -- Viz "consumes only this plus recorded
 * channel data" (schema.ts) rather than recomputing physics, unlike
 * `hud-readout.ts`/`force-glyphs.ts`, which need a live `Model`/`EvalContext`
 * for genuinely derived quantities (E, Re, S, Π) that aren't themselves
 * recorded channels.
